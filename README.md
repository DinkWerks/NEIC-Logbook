# NEIC-Logbook
An integrated billing and work tracking system for the Northeast Information Center.

## Purpose
The [NEIC](https://www.csuchico.edu/neic/) Logbook was designed to replace and synthesize a few databases and spreadsheets that were being used to manage our projects and billing. The goal is to offer a standardized form for entering data coupled with a means for automating the production of some billing documentation. This application is specifically applicable as an internal tool for the NEIC, but specific components may be usable by other Information Centers of the [California Historical Resources Information System](http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=1068).
